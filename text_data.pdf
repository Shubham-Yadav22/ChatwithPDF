Herbert Vighnāntaka Günther (17 March 1917 – 11 March 2006) was a German Buddhist philosopher and Professor and Head of the Department of Far Eastern Studies at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada. He held this position from the time he left India in 1964.

Early life: Herbert Günther was born in Bremen, Germany, as the only son of Reinhold Günther and his wife. Because he showed a great interest in the Orient from an early age, his father encouraged him to pursue studies in this field. To this end, he began the study of the Chinese language when he was nine. By the time he graduated from high school in 1936, he had also learned the Sanskrit language.

Education and early academia: Günther went to Munich for further study after graduation, earning the Ph.D. degree in 1939. Four years later he received the degree Dr. Phil. Habil. in Vienna. From this beginning, Günther went on to become one of the leading Buddhist scholars of our time. Amongst the most influential of his European mentors were Professor Wilhelm Geiger, a specialist in Pali and Sinhalese, and Walter Wüst – both of Munich. In Vienna, W. Havers was his main teacher. During this time his aptitude for languages manifested itself. In addition to Pali, Sinhalese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese, English, German, Russian, and Hindi, there were those languages he studied 'for enjoyment' – Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Spanish, and Italian. He progressed to teaching and taught at Vienna University from 1943 to 1950. Guenther left in 1950, refusing to serve under the rehabilitated ex-Nazi, Erich Frauwallner, whose academic chair had been restored to him.

Travels to India: Günther journeyed to India, where he lived and taught for the next fourteen years. From 1950 to 1958, he was at Lucknow University, where he developed a deep friendship with Kailas Nath Kaul, a naturalist, ethnologist, and philosopher. He then went to the Sanskrit University in Varanasi, where he was Head of the Department of Comparative Philosophy and Buddhist Studies from 1958 to 1963. The following year was spent at the International School of America.

The personal and intellectual encounters Günther had in India and the Himalayan region were to leave a lasting mark, for he was fortunate in studying with many prominent Tibetan and Mongolian lamas. Among encounters of special note were those with the following teachers: the Dalai Lama; Khri-byang Blo-bzang Ye-shes Rin-po-che, tutor to the Dalai Lama; the Incarnate Lama Ka-thog dbon sprul-sku; the Incarnate Lama Dar-mdo-sprul-sku Thub-bstan Ihun-grub legs-bzang of 'Bras sprungs Blo gsal-gling rgyal-rong and Abbot of Budhgaya; the Incarnate Lama Tarthang Tulku (Dar-thang sprul-sku), formerly of Golog Monastery in Tibet and the Sanskrit University in Varanasi, and presently Head Lama of the Tibetan Nyingma Meditation Center and Nyingma Institute in Berkeley.

Family: Throughout his career, he was encouraged and sustained by his wife, Ilse (née Rossrucker) Günther, whom he married in 1944 in Vienna. The Günthers had two daughters: Edith Kimball, now of Stockton, California – a former recipient of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and Master of Arts from the University of Saskatchewan; and Nora Günther, who presently studies music at Brandon University, in Brandon, Manitoba. The Günther family has, for many years, enjoyed musical performance – Günther was a flautist, his wife plays the piano, and their daughter Nora plays the viola.

Academic legacy: Günther was a pioneer in addressing contemporary philosophical issues from a deep and learned Buddhist perspective. His work is well known for being difficult to read. Defenders have argued that because both Buddhist and European philosophies have built up rich vocabularies and conceptual systems derived from over the centuries, any attempt at synthesis is necessarily complicated.

Brij Narayan Chakbast, born on January 19, 1882, was an Urdu poet from a Kashmiri Pandit family that settled in North India in the 15th century. Born in Faizabad near Lucknow, Chakbast's father, Pandit Udit Narayan Chakbast, was also a poet and held the position of deputy collector, the highest post for an Indian at that time. After his father's death, the family moved to Lucknow where Chakbast received his education. He later became a successful lawyer, earning his B.A. in 1905 and L.L.B. in 1907 from Canning College, Lucknow. Chakbast married twice, losing his first wife and child in 1906. He actively participated in social and political affairs, advocating for Home Rule and participating in the Home Rule Movement.

Chakbast made significant contributions to Urdu literature, excelling in both poetry and prose. Influenced by poets like Ghalib, Mir Anis, and Aatish, he primarily focused on nazm poetry. His notable works include "Khak-e-Hind," "Gulzar-e-Naseem," "Ramayan ka ek scene," "Nala-e-Dard," "Nala-e-Yaas," and the play "Kamla." His poetry often reflected intense patriotism, a central theme in his works.

Chakbast's premature death at the age of 44 was a great loss to Urdu literature, but his legacy lives on through his exemplary works. His complete collection, "Kulliyate-Chakbast" and "Maqalaat-e-Chakbast," was published posthumously on the poet's birth centenary in 1983, compiled by Kalidas Gupta 'Raza.'

Chakbast's poetry has also been featured in the 2015 film "Masaan," where it is showcased alongside the works of other renowned poets like Basheer Badr, Akbar Allahabadi, Mirza Ghalib, and Dushyant Kumar. This inclusion was a conscious tribute, highlighting the significance of Urdu poetry, particularly among millennial and generation X youngsters in Northern India, especially when in love.









Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer, born on August 29, 1803, was a prominent Urdu poet known for his mastery in Marsiya writing, a form of elegiac poetry. He is considered one of the foremost exponents of Marsiya Nigari, along with Mir Anees.

Born in Delhi, Mirza Dabeer began reciting Marsiya from childhood during Muharram gatherings called majalis. He received his early education under the guidance of Mir Muzaffar Husain Zameer. Later, he migrated to Lucknow, where he found a conducive environment to hone his skills in Marsiya writing. Mirza Dabeer was also a scholar of his time, known for his erudition.

Throughout his life, Mirza Dabeer wrote numerous elegies, salams, nauhas, quatrains, and ghazals. His Marsiya compositions are considered exemplary, with his poetic expressions deeply rooted in the tragic events of Karbala. Despite being primarily known for Marsiya, he also dabbled in other forms of Urdu poetry, including salaam and rubai.

Mirza Dabeer's rivalry with Mir Anis, another celebrated Urdu poet known for his Marsiya writing, is widely debated and discussed in Urdu literature. Their rivalry led to the development of two distinct styles of Marsiya writing, with supporters identifying themselves as "Aneesiya" and "Dabeeriya." Despite this rivalry, both poets held each other in high regard, and when Mir Anis passed away in 1874, Mirza Dabeer penned a tribute to him, acknowledging his greatness.

Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer's legacy in Urdu literature is significant, particularly in the realm of Marsiya. Along with Mir Anis, he left an indelible mark on Urdu literature, influencing generations of poets who followed. Their contributions to Marsiya elevated the genre to new heights, making it synonymous with their names. Today, Mirza Dabeer's poetry continues to be studied and appreciated for its profound themes and exquisite craftsmanship.
